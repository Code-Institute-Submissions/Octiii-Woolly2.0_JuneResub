    ​	The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page , this is to facilitate access to the buttons and make navigating the website as easy as possible.

### Validator testing.

HTML validator no Errors found. 

For index.html and our_products.html there are warnings about using h1 as not a top level element. This is used to save on CSS code by using basic HTML wich gives the text the exact size and shape needed.

CSS code no Errors found. 

There is a warning however about using -webkit-mask-image as a vendor extension. This could possibly cause some errors on some browsers.

### Deployment.

The website was deployed using Replit. Using Replit is very simple, the website was deployed by inserting all the images, HTML files, CSS files and JS files into the website. Then click Run on the top wich gives an output and provides a link to the deployed website.
